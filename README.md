# 4th BioHackathon Germany
## Project: Integrating Data Science Capabilities within the OMERO Data Management Ecosystem

This repo works to collect matherial, issues and results from the Project

### Project Description

OMERO is a widely adopted, open-source data management platform designed to support the handling, visualization, and analysis of biological imaging data. It is a central infrastructure in the global bioimaging community, providing robust solutions for organizing, sharing, and storing microscopy data. Within Germany, OMERO has become a key component of the NFDI4BIOIMAGE consortium—part of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)—which aims to enable FAIR and sustainable research data management in the field of bioimage analysis.

This project will enhance the functionality of existing OMERO plugins with a focus on data science applications. By addressing current limitations, resolving software issues, and extending plugin capabilities, we aim to improve the user experience and enable more advanced, integrated data analysis capabilities. These improvements will help transform OMERO into a more powerful and accessible tool for image-based research. Participants in the project will be able to contribute in various ways, including writing tests, improving documentation, debugging issues, and developing new functionality. We propose two key focus areas for development, though contributions are not limited to these.

### Hackaton schedule

Hacking will take place between **December 1st and 5th, 2025, starting at 13:00**. The last day will be mainly for presenting results and wrapping up.
